# ez solution to importing anki cloze cards -> quizlet

1. Go to Anki, Go to File > Export > NOTES in plain text (leave the html unchecked)
2. Copy and paste it into the first box, on the (rudimentary) website 
3. Copy the text from the website, and make sure you don't go beyond the "this is the
   500th line" mark, since Quizlet only allows so much without lagging foreeeveeer. 
5. Open Quizlet, create a flashcard set
6. Paste it into the import your data thing
7. Between the term and definition, write "Answer:"
8. Between the cards, choose "new Line'
9. lowk these are just notes for myself lmao
